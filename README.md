Discover Meteor Book - tutorial app

This is the end result of the tutorial from the Discover Meteor book.
I highly reccomend the book. You can get it at http://http://www.discovermeteor.com/ The git repository for the discover meteor example is at https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope.

I wanted to put this in my repository for referrence. Please don't use this. Buy the book and make your own.

Install meteor then Install meteorite
